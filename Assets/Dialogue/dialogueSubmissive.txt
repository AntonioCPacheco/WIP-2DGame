I guess we’re stuck in here. Do you want to work together?-Let's do it!-I guess...|It looks like we need to choose who goes through which door.-Would you like to choose? I can go through the door on the right, if you prefer the one on the left.-If that's what you want.-No, I'm going through the right door.-Yes, go through the right door. I'll take the left one.-Sorry, but I'd prefer going through the door on the right.|I feel good about our chances. What do you think? Should we keep going?-Let's do it!-Okay.|So, friend, which door do you want to go through?-That's fine.-I'm actually going through the left one, you take the other one.-Can I take the left one? Please?-That's fine! I wanted to go through the right one anyway.|We’re making progress! It’s getting a bit harder... But we might be able to do it.-A-B|How about we play rock paper scissors for the doors? Whoever wins can choose which door they go through.-left-right-right-left|I’m glad to see you.
I thought I wouldn’t make it… Those spikes sure looked deadly.-A-B|Maybe I’ll go through the left door... Or maybe the right one?
I can’t decide, you choose.-left-right-left-right|Damn, I’m not sure I want to keep going… What if I slip and fall on those spikes?-A-B|Look! The exit!
Oh… Only one door…-What are we going to do now? What do you think? Should we race?-A-B-A-B
