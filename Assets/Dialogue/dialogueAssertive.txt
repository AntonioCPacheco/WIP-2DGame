We have to work together to leave this place. We can better our chances if we cooperate. What do you say, pal?-Let's do it!-I guess...|It looks like we need to choose who goes through which door.-Alright! I want to go through the one on the right, can you go through the one on the left?-If that's what you want.-No, I'm going through the right door.-Yes, go through the right door. I'll take the left one.-Sorry, but I'd prefer going through the door on the right.|Well, that was easy. I feel good about our chances!
Let’s keep going!-Let's do it!-Okay.|Alright, I’ll take the one on the left this time. We can do this, friend!-That's fine.-I'm actually going through the left one, you take the other one.-Can I take the left one? Please?-That's fine! I wanted to go through the right one anyway.|We're making progress! It's getting a bit harder though. Let’s keep pushing forward!-Yeah, it is getting harder!-All right, let's go.|Okay, how about this? We’re going to play rock paper scissors for the doors. Whoever wins goes through the door on the right.-All right, I'll count.-Okay, let's play.|You made it!
I almost kicked the bucket back there… Those spikes looked extra sharp.-We should be careful...-I almost didn't make it either.|I am getting tired of picking doors. Do whatever you want this time. 
Go ahead, choose.-I'm going left.-I'm going right.-Can you go right?-Could you go left?|Wow! That was tough...
No time to think about what could have happened though, let’s go.-Come on! We can do this!-It was pretty tough...|Look! The exit!-It looks like there’s only one door for the two of us though.-This is it then. I have enjoyed knowing you, but only one of us is getting out of here.-I don't know about you, but I don't want to be left behind.-I'm not going to stay here either!-It has been a pleasure. May the best one win!-Go ahead, I would rather stay.-You can go, I'm not sure I want to leave.|Wait, what are you doing?
Are you not even going to try?-As I said, I really don't want to stay here, so if you're not going to, I will go through that door.-I just don't think I can leave you behind...-I would rather save you than myself.-I guess you're right, I might as well try...-I was just getting ready, let's go!|I appreciate your sacrifice, thank you. I won't forget you.
