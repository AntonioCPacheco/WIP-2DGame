What do you say, pal?-Let's do it!-I guess...|It looks like we need to choose who goes through which door.-Alright! I want to go through the one on the right, can you go through the one on the left?-If that's what you want.-No, I want to go through the right one.-Yes, you go through the right door. I'll take the left one.-Sorry, but if you don't mind I'd prefer going through the one on the right.|Well, that was easy. I feel good about our chances!

We can do this, friend!-That's okay, I don't mind either one.-I'm actually going through the left one, you take the other one.-Can I take the left one? Please?-That's fine! I wanted to go through the right one anyway.|Hey! I just pulled a lever that didn’t seem to change anything here, did you notice anything change?-Yes!
