We have to work together to leave this place. We can better our chances if we cooperate. What do you say, pal?-Let's do it!-I guess...|It looks like we need to choose who goes through which door.-Alright! I want to go through the one on the right, can you go through the one on the left?-If that's what you want.-No, I want to go through the right one.-Yes, you go through the right door. I'll take the left one.-Sorry, but if you don't mind I'd prefer going through the one on the right.|Well, that was easy. I feel good about our chances!
Let’s keep going!-Let's do it!-Okay.
